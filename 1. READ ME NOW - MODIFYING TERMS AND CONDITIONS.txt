When you're making a modified version of this mission, however minor the change:

1. Name it differently in
   a) mission name (weather menu, NOT JUST THE VERSION NUMBER!)
   b) filename
   so that neither can be mistaken for an official version.
2. Include yourself in the briefing's credits section (init.sqs).

Because:
I do not want people to join a server thinking they get to play the official version when they don't.
I do not want people to think that your version is a new official release.
I do not want people to download a modified version that overwrites the original.
I do not want to be blamed for your errors and design solutions.
It's common courtesy to let people know who modified the mission.


That is the least you can do to prevent inevitable confusion.



You can use the scripts in your own missions if you give due credit.
I have commented the scripts to the best of my ability so figuring them out is preferably your job.

I reserve the right to be the sole maker of "<place name> Apocalypse" zombie missions that use this script base.

Thanks,
